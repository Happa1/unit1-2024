# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all her transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms. Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

An example of the data stored is 

| Date | Description | Category | Amount  |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Sep 23 2022 | bought a house | Expenses | 10 BTC |
| Sep 24 2022 | food for house celebration | Food | 0.000001 BTC |


## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make an electronic ledger for a client who is Ms.Sato. 
The electronic ledger will about the system which records transaction of cryptocurrency and display clear profit and exchange. 
It is constructed by using the software, "PyCharm" and programming language, Python. It will take 3 weeks to make it and will 
be evaluated according to the success criteria below.

## Description of the coin
Litecoing is the second-oldest cryptoncurrency created from a fork in the Bitoboin blockchain in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee. Litecoin was released with 150 pre-mined coins and has a total supply of 84 million coins, and its blockchain generates a new block every 2.5 minutes. A new hashing algorithm allows to reduce over time to preserce the coin's value and faster transaction speeds.

## Tools of my solution
I decided to use python this time because it is the most common language in programming, so that she can understand the code easily and other developers will be able to improve my program in the future. I also used Pycharm to develop this program because it has a good UI and many funtionc to indicate possible error occurs to prevent the code from messing up.
To accomplish the client's requirements, I imported pands, time, textwrap, datetime, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries, and also used csv file to record user data and transaction data. These libraries allowed me to make advanced program without complicated codes, and csv file makes it easy to create, read, and edit it.

## Structure of my solution
To ensure the security of electronic ledger, I want to create a system of singup, login, and logout. I also want to create function of deposit, withdrawal, balance, transaction table, and chart to make it easier for the client to use electroni ledger and show her transaction visually through table and line graph.
I specified those structures in the success criteria below.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger has sign up, log in, and log out system.
5. The electronic ledger display the exchange of currency (yen and dollars).
6. The electronic ledger display profit after user enter or withdraw cryptocurrency.
7. The electronic ledger display the bar chart of transaction and profit.

# Criteria C: Development

## Signup System
My client requires a system to protect the private data. I thought about using a singup system to accomplish this requrement using if condition and the open command to work with csv file.
As you can see in the flow diagram in **Fig**, if the client choose a signup option in the home option (home_option==1), I defined function called try_singup, this function has three inputs of type string, and the output is a boolean representing True if the user signups correctly or False otherwise.
This is saved in the signup_success. 
Then in line 4, I opened the users.csv file with reading mode, and set data as f.readlines().
From line 7 to 12, I set a loop to read all lines in user.csv file to ask users to enter new username again if the username they set first has already used by other users.
In line 8 and 9, I split each line of username as uname and password as upass.
From line 10-12, I set while loop which functions if username singup_username input is in username in user.csv file.
If signup_username is in uname, print error message, and ask users to input their new username in line 12.
From line 14 to 18, I set while loop to show error if the password they enter first is different from the confirmation password.
In line 15, if signup_password is different from conf_pasword, I print error message, and I ask to enter new password in line 16.
If sinup_password is the same with conf_password, I break the while loop.
In line 20,if user correctly singup by using username and pass word, I make singup_success True.
In line 22, if singup_success is True, I set variable line_signup, which username and password they set will be record in line splitting by comma in line23.
Then in line 24, I opened the users.csv file as adding mode, and record line_singup.
Then from line 27 to36, I'll make a default user csv file for each user to record their transaction.
In line 27, I set the first row of atm file to define the colum of the file, "Date", "Description", "Category", "Amount", "Balance".
In line 28, I import datetime, and set variable date as today's date.
In line 29, I set variable description as "-----".
In line 30, I set variable category as "-----".
In line 31, I set variable amount as 0 because there is no transaction happened.
In line 32, I set variable balance as 0 because there is no transaction happened yet.
In line 33, I set variable line_atm_2, which combines five variables that I set above as one line, splitting by comma.
In line 34, I open new csv file which use singup_username for the name of the file, and as writing mode.
In line 35, I connect all values in line_atm_1 by comma, and record each value as colum of atm csv file.
In line 36, I record line_atm_2.
If all of these signup process done by successfully, it shows the message in red color in line 38.
In line 40, return singup_success as True, if the user can signup successfully, and end try_signup function.
In line 42 to 44, I ask user to enter username, password, and confirmation password, and put those three inputs in the variable of signup and start try_signup function in line 45.
In line 46, set username variable as username which used in signup to use that username in other sessions.
After signup session ends, it moves to the home questions which asks user to choose signup or login.


```.py
if home_option == 1: # Sign up
    def try_signup(signup_username:str, signup_password:str, conf_password:str)->bool:
        signup_success=False
        with open('users.csv', mode='r') as f:
            data = f.readlines()

        for line in data:
            uname = line.split(',')[0]
            upass = line.split(',')[1].strip()  # strip() remove \n
            while signup_username in uname:
                print("Your username is invalid")
                signup_username = input("Please enter your new username: ")

        while signup_password != conf_password:
            print("The password dosen't match, please enter the password again: ")
            conf_password = input("[Error] Enter your password again: ")
            if signup_password==conf_password:
                break

        signup_success = True

        if signup_success == True:
            line_signup = f"{signup_username},{signup_password}\n"
            with open('users.csv', mode='a') as f:
                data = f.writelines(line_signup)

            line_atm_1 = ["Date", "Description", "Category", "Amount", "Balance"]
            date = datetime.date.today()  # today's date
            description = "-----"
            category = "-----"
            amount = 0
            balance = 0
            line_atm_2 = f"{date},{description},{category},{amount},{balance}\n"
            with open(f'atm{signup_username}.csv', mode='w') as f:
                f.writelines(','.join(line_atm_1) + '\n')
                f.writelines(line_atm_2)

        print( f"{red}You are successfully sign upped!{c_end}")

        return(signup_success)

    in_signup_username = input("Enter your username: ")
    in_signup_password = input("Enter your password: ")
    in_conf_password = input("[Confirmation]Enter your password again: ")
    signup=try_signup(signup_username=in_signup_username,signup_password=in_signup_password,conf_password=in_conf_password)
    username = in_signup_username
    # print(signup)

    print(f"1:Sign up\n2:Login")
    username = ''
    home_option = validate_int(msg="Please choose one, and enter the number: ", menu='', type='option')
    while not home_option in [1, 2]:
        home_option = validate_int(msg="[Error] Please choose one, and enter the number: ", menu='', type='option')
```

## Login System
My client requires a system to protect her private data, so I set sign up function as I mentioned above. Since, we have a signup function, I thought creating login system to utilize that username and password effectively to secure a client's account.
As you can see in the flow diagram **Fig**, if the client choose a login option in the home option (home_option==2), I defined function called try_login, this function has two inputs of type string, and the output is a boolean representing True if the user logins correctly or False otherwise.
This is saved in Login.
Then in line 3, I opened users.csv file as reading mode, and set vriable data as readlines().
In line 6, I set Login as False.
From line 7 to 12, read the users.csv file by splitting each line by comma, and set the first value as variable uname and the second value as variable upass.
If uname is as same as username and upass is as same as password the user entered, Login becomes True and break loop of reading users.csv file.
In line 13, return Login.

From line 16, I create a system to ask user to login and if the user enter wrong password three times, the system won't accept any more login.
I asked to enter username and password in line 17 and 18, and start try_login function by using username and password that the user just entered.
If the password that the user enter is wrong and the number of time they make mistakes was less than three times, I ask the user to enter username and password again, and return result. Also, subtract -1 from attempts.

From line 26 to 28, if the result of login ends as False, which means that the user enter wrong username or password three times, the program exit to secure users' accounts.
In line 30, I set variable username as in_name, which is username that the user enter to login.


```.py
if home_option==2: #Login
    def try_login(name:str, password:str)->bool:
        with open('users.csv', mode='r') as f:
            data = f.readlines()

        Login = False
        for line in data:
            uname = line.split(',')[0]
            upass = line.split(',')[1].strip() #strip() remove \n
            if uname == name and upass==password:
                Login=True
                break
        return(Login)

    ###testing
    attempts = 3
    in_name=input("Enter your username: ")
    in_pass=input("Enter your password: ")
    result= try_login(name=in_name, password=in_pass)
    while result== False and attempts > 1:
        in_name = input("[Error try again] Enter your username: ")
        in_pass = input("[Error try again] Enter your password: ")
        result = try_login(name=in_name, password=in_pass)
        attempts -=1

    if result == False:
        print("Sayonara")
        exit(1) #1 is the code for exit without error

    username = in_name

```

## Deposit System
My client requires a system to record deposit of cryptocurrency transaction easily. I thought about using a deposit system to accomplish this, using a csv file.
As you can see the flow diagram from **Fig**, if the user choose the option deposit after she login (menu_option==1)
In line 2, I set variable date, to define today's date by using imported datetime.
In line 3, I ask user to enter the description of deposit to record the purpose of deposit.
In line 4, I set variable category, as deposit.
In line 5, I ask user to enter the amount of currency that the user wants to deposit and validate the value the user entered is whether integer or not, by using validate_int function.
In line 6, I call balance_calc function from my_lib.py to calculate the balance.
In line 8, I set variable line to combine all five variables above.
In line 9 and 10, I open atm csv file which the file name is unique to depending on users, and open it as adding mode, and record the line variable.
In line 12, after 1 second pause, display "Saved" to inform the user that deposit is recorded.
In line 14, I print the balance by using balance variable to inform the user her current balance.


```.py
if menu_option == 1:  # Deposit
    date = datetime.date.today()  # today's date
    description = input("Please enter the description: ")
    category = "deposit"
    amount = validate_int(msg="Please enter amount to deposit: ", menu="", type="amount")
    balance = balance_calc(df=pd.read_csv(f'atm{username}.csv'), amount=amount)
    
    line = f"{date},{description},{category},{amount},{balance}\n"
    with open(f'atm{username}.csv', mode='a') as f:
        f.writelines(line)
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Saved")
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"Your balance is {balance}")
        time.sleep(1)
```

## Withdrawal System
My client requires a system to record withdrawal of cryptocurrency transaction easily. I thought about using a withdrawal system to accomplish this, using a csv file.
As you can see the flow diagram from **Fig**, if the user choose the option withdrawal after she login (menu_option==2).
In line 2, I set variable date, to define today's date by using imported datetime.
In line 3, I ask user to enter the description of withdrawal to record the purpose of deposit.
In line 4, I set variable category, as deposit.
In line 5, I ask user to enter the amount of currency that the user wants to deposit and validate the value the user entered is whether integer or not, by using validate_int function.
In line 6, I call balance_calc function from my_lib.py to calculate the balance.
In line 8, I set variable line to combine all five variables above.
In line 9 and 10, I open atm csv file which the file name is unique to depending on users, and open it as adding mode, and record the line variable.
In line 12, after 1 second pause, display "Saved" to inform the user that withdrawal is recorded.
In line 14, I print the balance by using balance variable to inform the user her current balance.

```.py
    if menu_option == 2:  # Withdrawal
        date = datetime.date.today()  # today's date
        description = input("Please enter the description: ")
        category="withdrawal"
        amount = validate_int(msg="Please enter amount to withdrawal: ", menu="", type="amount")
        amount = -1 * amount
        balance = balance_calc(df=pd.read_csv(f'atm{username}.csv'), amount=amount)
        
        line = f"{date},{description},{category},{amount},{balance}\n"
        with open(f'atm{username}.csv', mode='a') as f:
            f.writelines(line)
        time.sleep(1)
        print("Saved")
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"Your balance is {balance}")
        time.sleep(1)
```

## Debt classification System
My client requires a system to know her balance is whether in black or not after she deposits or withdrawals money. I thought creating debt classification system by using balance variable and if condition is suitable to accomplish this requirement.
I use the variable balance and display "You're not debt", and if the balance is below 0, display "You're debt".
```.py
if balance >= 0:
    print("You're not debt")
else:
    print("You're debt")
```

## Exchange currency System
My client requires exchange currency system to know how much value she has as a cryptocurrency in a real money value. I thought about using exchange currency system by getting the live price data of LTC in both dollar and yen and calculating its value.

I called the function get_ltc_price_usd that gets the rate of LTC coin by using CoinGecko api in dollar.
As I refer the documentation of CoinGecko, I called the url to get the price of cryptocurrency, and set litecoin in us dollars in params in line 3 to 7.
Then, if I get the data successfully from the server (response.status_code == 200), I transfer Jason data to python structure data in line 11.
I extract the key of litecoin and usd from the data, and set it in variable ltc_price, and return the price after the function ends in line 12 and 13.
If I fail to get the data from the server, I print error message and ends function with return None in line 14 to 16.

You can see the same structure for getting LTC price in Japanese yen in line 21 to 36.

‌

The functions above was stored in my_lib.py to make my main paython code concise, therefore I called the functions to my main python code, wallet.py, in line 39.
After the user done with deposit or withdrawal, ask the user to choose in which currency unit they want to see their LTC value in line 44, and set the option number as variable currency_exchange and call validate_int function to check it is valid number.
If user enter the number except 1, 2, and 3, the user will be asked again to enter the option number in line 44 and 45.
If the user choose us dollar (currency_exchange == 1), multiply balance and the LtC value in us dollar I get, and print that value in line 46 and 47.
I do the same process for Japanese yen which we can see it in line 48 and 49.
If the user choose option 3, set option_bool as False and exist deposit option on line 50 and 51.


```.py
```my_lib.py```
# get LTC data in dollar
def get_ltc_price_usd():
    url = "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price"
    params = {
        "ids": "litecoin",
        "vs_currencies": "usd"
    }

    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        ltc_price = data["litecoin"]["usd"]
        return ltc_price
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch data.")
        return None

ltc_price_usd = get_ltc_price_usd()

# get LTC data in yen
def get_ltc_price_jpy():
    url = "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price"
    params = {
        "ids": "litecoin",
        "vs_currencies": "jpy"
    }

    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        ltc_price = data["litecoin"]["jpy"]
        return ltc_price
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch data.")
        return None
ltc_price_jpy = get_ltc_price_jpy()

```wallet.py```
ltc_price_usd = get_ltc_price_usd()
ltc_price_jpy = get_ltc_price_jpy()
# import exchange currency function from my_lib.py
from  my_lib import get_ltc_price_usd, get_ltc_price_jpy

# after deposit or withdrawal finish successfully
print("Check currency in exchange of\n1: USD\n2: JPY")
currency_exchange = validate_int(msg="Choose the exchange currency: ", menu="", type="currency exchange")
while currency_exchange not in [1,2,3]:
           input(("[Invalid] Please enter currency exchange again:\n1: USD\n2: JPY\n3: skip this"))
       if currency_exchange == 1:
           exchanged_value = f"$ {balance * ltc_price_usd}"
       elif currency_exchange == 2:
           exchanged_value = f"¥ {balance * ltc_price_jpy}"
       elif currency_exchange ==3:
           option_bool=False
```

## Balance System
My client requires the system to know the balance of her account.
Import pandas as pd to read to call csv file in line 1.
Then I opened the function balance_calc, which receive the inputs dataframe and integer in line 2.
If we call the balance_calc function, we extract the value at the last row and last colum of the table from input, and adding amount to calculate the balance in line 3 to 5.
Then the function returns balance.
In main python code, wallet.py, I import balance_calc function from my_lib.py in line 8.
If user choose the menu of balance  (menu_option == 3), the program start the session of balance in line 10.
In line 11, I set variable balance and call the function of balance calc and use user's atm csv file and amount is 0 as are inputs.
In line 12, I set variable today, by using datetime, and insert today's date in that.
In line 13, I set variable msg which shows balance by using variable today and balance.
In line 14, I print balance by using banner_maker function imported from my_lib.py with inputs of msg=msg, space=50, symbol='$'.


```.py
```my_lib.py```
import pandas as pd
def balance_calc(df:pd.core.frame.DataFrame,amount:int):
    last_row = df.iloc[-1]
    balance_pre = last_row.iloc[-1]
    balance = balance_pre + amount
    return balance

```wallet.py```
from  my_lib import balance_calc

if menu_option == 3:  # calculate balance
    balance = balance_calc(df=pd.read_csv(f'atm{username}.csv'), amount=0)
    print(balance)
    today = datetime.date.today()
    msg = f"Your balance {today} is ¥{balance}"
    print(banner_maker(msg=msg, space=50, symbol='$'))
```

## Transaction table System
My client requires to record and show her deposit and withdrawal data with clear visual. I thought creating transaction table shown in markdown style by using atm csv file which records user's deposit and withdrawal data.
If user choose menu of transaction table (menu_option == 4), the program start the session of transaction table, in line 1.
I call user's atm csv file in line 2, and print the data in the csv file in markdown style without index.
```.py
if menu_option ==4: #Transaction table
    df = pd.read_csv(f'atm{username}.csv')
    print(df.to_markdown(index=False))
```

## Chart System
My client requires a system to see her transaction history visually easy to understandable. I thought creating line graph to show user's deposit, withdrawal, and balance history by using user's atm csv file and matplotlib.pyplot.
In line 1, I imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt to import library to draw graph.
In line 2, I imported pandas library as pd to read csv file.
If user choose menu of transaction table (menu_option == 5), the program start the session of chart, in line 3.
I open user's atm csv file with pandas' function in line 4.
Then, show option of drawing chart, deposit, withdrawal, and balance, and ask user to enter the option number and validate that number by validate_int function in line 5.
If user choose deposit (category_choice == 1), create new dataframe, dfr, by extracting lines if "Category" colum is "deposit" from the user's atm csv file in line 11.
I set variable x_axis value as "Date" in dfr, and variable y_axis as "Amount" in dfr in line 8 and 9.
I set plot title, legend, x label, y label in line 12 to 15.
In line 16, I plot line graph by using x_axis and y_axis variables.
I rotate the xticks 30 degrees clockwise in line 17.
I display the plot in line 18.
If user choose withdrawal (category_choice==2) from line 21 to 31, or balance (category_choice==3) from line 30 to 40, follow the same process above.

```.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
if menu_option ==5:
    df = pd.read_csv(f'atm{username}.csv')
    category_choice=validate_int(msg="1: Deposit\n2: Withdrawal\n3: Balance\nChoose the category that you want to see graph: ",menu='',type="category")
    while category_choice not in [1,2,3]:
        category_choice = validate_int(msg="[Invalid] Please enter category again\n1: Deposit\n2: Withdrawal\n3: Balance: ", menu="", type="category")
    if category_choice==1:
        dfr = df[df["Category"] == "deposit"]
        x_axis = dfr.Date
        y_axis = dfr.Amount
        plt.title("Deposit History")
        plt.legend("Deposit")
        plt.xlabel("Date")
        plt.ylabel("Amount")
        plt.plot(x_axis, y_axis)
        plt.xticks(rotation=30)
        plt.show()
    elif category_choice==2:
        dfr = df[df["Category"] == "withdrawal"]
        x_axis = dfr.Date
        y_axis = dfr.Amount
        plt.title("Withdrawal History")
        plt.legend("Withdrawal")
        plt.xlabel("Date")
        plt.ylabel("Amount")
        plt.plot(x_axis, y_axis)
        plt.xticks(rotation=30)
        plt.show()
    elif category_choice==3:
        dfr = df["Balance"]
        x_axis = dfr.Date
        y_axis = dfr.Amount
        plt.title("Balance History")
        plt.legend("Balance")
        plt.xlabel("Date")
        plt.ylabel("Amount")
        plt.plot(x_axis, y_axis)
        plt.xticks(rotation=30)
        plt.show()
```

## Logout System
My client requires to log out from her bank ledger to protect her account. I thought creating logout system which ends the program without error by using if condition and exit code to accomplish client's requirements.
If user choose logout (menu_option == 6), I ask user that you want to log out and answer in yYnN in line 1 and 2.
If the letter user entered is not yYnN, I ask again user to enter one of yYnN in line 3.
If the user's choice was yes to log out, I exit from the program without any errors by exit(1) in line 8 to 11.
If the user's choice was no to log out, I set option_bool as False and display the menu again in line 10 to 12.
```.py
if menu_option == 6:
    logout_choice = input("Do you want to log out? (Y/N)")
    while not logout_choice in "yYnN":
        logout_choice = input("[Error] Do you want to log out? (Y/N)")

        if logout_choice in "yY":
            time.sleep(1)
            print('You logged out')
            exit(1)
        else:
            time.sleep(2)
            option_bool = False
```
